                    <h2 class="custom-google-text">Events Hosted by WCA</h2>
                    <p>The WCA plays a crucial role in organizing and hosting speedcubing competitions around the world. The WCA follows standardized rules and regulations to ensure fair and consistent competition across different events and locations.</p>
                    <p>One of the most prestigious events hosted by the WCA is the World Rubik's Cube Championship, which takes place every two years. This international event brings together top speedcubers from all over the world to compete for the title of world champion in various events, including the 3x3, 2x2, 4x4, 5x5, blindfolded, one-handed, and fewest moves categories.</p>
                    <p>The Rubik's Cube community is known for its inclusivity and diversity, with participants ranging from young children to senior citizens, and from beginners to world-class speedcubers. The competitions are not just about winning, they are also about learning, sharing, and having fun.</p>

                    <h2 class="custom-google-text">The World of Speedcubing</h2>
                    <p>Speedcubing is not limited to just solving the classic 3x3 Rubik's Cube. There are various other types of events that cater to different skill levels and interests of cubers. Some of the popular types of speedcubing events include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>2x2 Cube:</strong> This event involves solving the 2x2 version of Rubik's Cube, which is a smaller and simpler version compared to the classic 3x3 cube. Despite their smaller size, speedcubers still aim to achieve lightning-fast solve times using advanced techniques and algorithms.</li>
                        <li><strong>4x4, 5x5, 6x6, and 7x7 Cube:</strong> These events involve solving the larger and more complex versions of the Rubik's Cube. These cubes have additional layers and require more advanced solving methods, making them a challenging yet thrilling event for speedcubers who want to test their skills.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blindfolded Solving:</strong> In this event, participants attempt to solve the Rubik's Cube blindfolded, relying solely on their memory and spatial reasoning skills. This event requires exceptional memorization skills, mental focus, and a deep understanding of cube algorithms.</li>
                        <li><strong>One-Handed Solving:</strong> As the name suggests, this event involves solving the Rubik's Cube using only one hand. It requires a different set of finger tricks and techniques to achieve fast solve times, making it a unique and exciting event for cubers looking for a challenge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fewest Moves:</strong> In this event, participants aim to solve the Rubik's Cube using the fewest number of moves possible. This event tests the strategic thinking and planning skills of speedcubers, as they try to optimize their solves to achieve the lowest move count.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h2 class="custom-google-text">Records Set by Participants</h2>
                    <p>Speedcubing competitions are not just about participating, they are also about setting new records and pushing the limits of what seems possible. The WCA maintains a comprehensive database of world records for various categories, including single solve and an average of 5 solves.</p>
                    <p>For example, in the 3x3 single solve category, the current world record stands at under 4 seconds, with some speedcubers consistently achieving solve times below 5 seconds. In the average of 5 solves category, the record is currently under 6 seconds, which means the speedcuber solved the cube 5 times in a row with an average time of less than 6 seconds per solve.</p>

                    <h2 class="custom-google-text">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The world of Rubik's Cube competitions is a fascinating blend of skill, strategy, and community. Whether you're a seasoned speedcuber or just starting out, these events offer a unique opportunity to challenge yourself, learn from others, and be part of a global community united by their love for this iconic puzzle. As records continue to be broken and new solving techniques are developed, the future of speedcubing looks brighter and more exciting than ever.</p>
